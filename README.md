# VigenereCipherProjectCIS7

The purpose of this program is to create a Vigenere Cipher that'll ask the user to input a word as well as a key to use for the cipher.

There isn't any error catching just a straight forward cipher. It'll give the title of the program as well as a menu with options 1, 2, and 3.
If you choose 1 it'll walk you through a series of questions, to input a word then a key for encryption, then it'll display the word after
encryption and then again after decryption.
Choose 3 to exit the program.
